        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">HouseFinder is A Web-based House Information System. It is proposed by Rustine Louise Agbayani and Reuben Derick Llanes, 4th year students currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from University of Perpetual Help - Molino. The focus of this research project is basically managing housing for low income, medium and high incomes households or what is commonly known as affordable housing. “Affordable” is a term used to describe individuals’ capability to pay for certain products or services because their income is enough to do so. Although the term “affordable housing” is often applied to rental housing; that is within the financial means of those in the lower income ranges of a geographical area, the concept is applicable to both middle and high-income individuals.</p>
